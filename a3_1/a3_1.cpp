 Assignment 3.1
 
 Program asks user to play guessing game whereby the program guesses user's number from 1
 to 100, inclusive, based on guessing the midpoints. User indicates whether the number is
 higher, lower or correct based on the guess. Game continues until the program accurately
 guesses the correct number. Program asks user to play again.
